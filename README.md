# NREL_DataMining
A Practice/Showcase project of NREL Dataset mining

Premise: 
The NSRDB is a database collection of meteorological data containing measurements calculating solar radiation which can be converted to energy. NSRDB is a publicly available database which charges nothing for their data.

Goal:
Set up options for Data Mining Analysis techniques to be done on data from a specific region if available. 

Goal includes:
- Set up ETL Process to make data readable to the machine
- Add query modification options: Location (Latitude and Longitude or Country, City, Address and Zip), if given only a country and zip/city and state/, find the box around that region and make a region query
- TBD
